# p4project
The goal of this project is to implement a packet filter on a programmable switch, using the P4 language. The packet filter will enable the administrator of the network to block packets based on physical ingress and/or egress interfaces, IP source or destination address, protocol type in IP datagram field (TCP, UDP, ICMP, OSPF), and TCP or UDP source and destination port.
